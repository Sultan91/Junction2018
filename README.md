The Building Performance Database (BPD) is the nation's largest dataset of information about the energy-related characteristics of commercial and residential buildings. The BPD allows users to explore the data across real estate sectors and regions, and compare various physical and operational characteristics to gain a better understanding of market conditions and trends in energy performance. This site has up-to-date documentation of the BPD Application Programming Interface (API). The API enables the sharing of content and data between applications, meaning that third party web or mobile applications can be dynamically updated with BPD data.

The Building Energy Data Book (2011) is a compendium of data from a variety of data sets and includes statistics on residential and commercial building energy consumption. Data tables contain statistics related to construction, building technologies, energy consumption, and building characteristics. The Building Technologies Office (BTO) within the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy developed this resource to provide a comprehensive set of buildings- and energy-related data.
